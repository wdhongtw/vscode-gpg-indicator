## Features

This extension will show the status of GPG signing key in status bar if your local
`.git/config` or any other default `.gitconfig` configuration file (e.g. `~/.gitconfig`):

- has set `commit.gpgSign` as `true` for git, and
- has set `user.signingKey` with GPG key ID for git

If the above conditions are both satisfied, there will be an indicator for your current
signing key, together with a cute icon to tell whether the key is unlocked or not.

When you click the indicator, you will be prompted for passphrase to unlock the key.

### Passphrase Cache

Since [VS Code 1.53](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_53#_secrets-api), the
[`SecretStorage` API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#ExtensionContext.secrets)
is introduced to provide a secure and persistent storage for secrets.
With this API, this extension can maintain passphrase cache for user.

You can enable the `gpgIndicator.enablePassphraseCache` option to opt-in, if so
your passphrase will be cached in the secret storage once you unlock your key.

After that, your key will be unlocked automatically whenever this extension is enabled.

You can list or delete your cached passphrase by command anytime.
When you disable the passphrase-cache option, the whole cache will be cleared.

## Requirements

- Linux (including WSL) or Windows. (Not tested in macOS, but should work.)
- GPG tool chain (`gpg`, `gpg-agent`, `gpg-connect-agent`) above 2.1

## FAQ

### How to get the key ID of my signing key?

The key ID of the signing key can be retrieved by the command
`gpg --list-keys --keyid-format long` .

Locate the key with singing capability (the `S` flag in square brackets),
and the key ID is the hex string after the algorithm identifier.
